Solstice
========
This project is a remake of Mikrogen's Equinox, a great game that I enjoyed a lot when I was a child.

In this game you control a drone with the mission of stabilize a nuclear plant that can blow in any moment. 
The drone has the ability to fly and shoot to destroy the baddies made by the radiation, at the cost of energy.

The drone is limited to carry one object at a time, some objects are needed to open closed areas, others fill
the drone's energy, etc.

There are 8 levels to complete and each level has a time limit.

Good luck.

============
At the moment there is no binary distribution of this project, to run this game install Python 2.7 and Pygame 1.9,
clone the project with git or download the source code from the button at the right and run python src/solstice.py.
